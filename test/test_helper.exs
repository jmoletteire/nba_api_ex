# This file is automatically run before any test files.
# It starts the ExUnit testing framework, which is required to run tests.
#
# You can also configure global test settings here, such as:
# - Output formatters
# - Random seed control
# - Application environment overrides
# - Starting supporting processes (e.g. Mox, Faker)
#
# Do not remove `ExUnit.start()` unless you're replacing it
# with a custom test runner.
